# Amazon Vine Analysis

### Overview
The purpose of this assignment was to determine bias of vine reviews.  Using SQL and PGADMIN4, I was able to run multiple queries to verify Amazon reviews based on star rating and whether there was bias towards paid or unpaid reviews.

### Summary
I don't believe there was bias based on there being far more reviews by unpaid reviewers than by paid reviewers, more than fifty percent.  In order to determine where there might be bias is to find out how many 1 star reviews were made by unpaid reviews in relation to paid 5 star reviews.
